## Timescapes Test Nick Virtue

Basic demo of fetching data from an API endpoint and displaying using custom components.

* Used custom hooks for data fetching
* Used pure components for data display

### Tech

* ReactQuery: Used as it's simple to get going and we used this in my previous jobs
* AI: Did not use

### Improvements

* Re-fetch the data every n seconds and return the previous results while doing so
* Add an interface to allow the user to select/enter a location
